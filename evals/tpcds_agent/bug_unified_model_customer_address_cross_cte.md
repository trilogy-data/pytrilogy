# Bug: unified-model 2-hop `customer.address` group/filter → cross-CTE "table not found"

**Status:** FIXED 2026-06-07 (found 2026-06-07, enriched eval q6). Root cause: datasource
inlining folded the raw `customer` table into the address-join CTE as an inlined-but-dangling
source — the FK key (`C_CURRENT_ADDR_SK`) was already materialized by the grouped parent CTE, so
the inlined customer table never reached the FROM, yet the address join's ON still referenced its
alias (a sibling CTE's), hence "table not found". Fix (the report's render-side option) in
`_render_left_concept` (trilogy/dialect/common.py): when the join's recorded left node is not one
of the consumer's emitted parent CTEs but the left concept IS available from an emitted parent CTE
(per `source_map`), pin the key to that parent CTE. Covers both `purchasing_customer` and
`billing_customer` paths. Regression test `test_unified_model_customer_address_cross_cte_join`
(+ `_out_of_scope_join_aliases` static check) in
tests/modeling/tpc_ds_duckdb/test_non_benchmark_queries.py.
**Severity:** medium — grouping/filtering by a customer's address property on the unified
`all_sales` model generates SQL where the address join references the customer-table alias from a
*sibling* CTE, which DuckDB rejects. `generate_sql` succeeds; execution fails. Drove part of q6's
2M-token run (after a bad reviewer kickback pushed it onto the multi-channel path).

## Symptom

```
(_duckdb.BinderException) Binder Error: Referenced table "sales_purchasing_customer_customers" not found!
  Candidate tables: "sales_purchasing_customer_..."
```
The customer table alias is bound inside one CTE, but the `C_CURRENT_ADDR_SK → address` join is
rendered from a different (sibling) CTE that can't see it. Both `purchasing_customer.*` and
`billing_customer.*` address paths fail identically.

## Deterministic reproduction (checked-in enriched model)

Model: `tests/modeling/tpc_ds_duckdb` (`all_sales.preql`). Needs data — fails at execution. Use the
conftest engine (any scale factor):
```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<repo_root>")
from tests.modeling.tpc_ds_duckdb.conftest import _make_engine
eng = _make_engine(sf=0.01, subdir="memory_sf001")
sql = eng.generate_sql(BODY)[-1]          # succeeds
eng.execute_raw_sql(sql).fetchall()       # BinderException: table not found
```

`BODY` (minimal):
```trilogy
import all_sales as sales;
where sales.date.year = 2001
  and sales.purchasing_customer.address.id is not null
select
    sales.purchasing_customer.address.state as state,
    count(sales.item.id) as n
limit 100;
```

## Minimization

- Trigger = **group by a 2-hop `<role>_customer.address.<prop>` on the unified model + filter on
  that same address path** (`purchasing_customer.address.id is not null`). The avg-by-category
  threshold / `having` from the original q6 are NOT required.
- It is the **unified `all_sales`** multi-arm structure that splits the customer and address joins
  across CTEs. (A single-channel base model with a direct customer→address path does not exhibit
  this — worth confirming the fix covers both.)

## Suggested fix

The address join must render in (or against) the same CTE/scope that binds the customer alias it
depends on. Either keep the customer→address join chain together in one CTE, or qualify the address
join's FROM-source to the CTE that actually exposes the customer key (cf. the analogous cross-CTE
join-key fix in `bug_B2_invalid_reference_codegen.md`, `dialect/common.py _render_left_concept`).

## Provenance

Enriched eval q6 (states with ≥10 customers buying items priced > 1.2× their category average). The
agent navigated `purchasing_customer.address.state` (the customer's current home-address state) on
`all_sales` and hit this on both the purchasing- and billing-customer paths (msgs 47/51). It only
reached the multi-channel `all_sales` path because a reviewer false-kickback wrongly told it the
store-only answer was incomplete (see the reviewer corpus case `agent_log.q06::0`, gold=DONE).
