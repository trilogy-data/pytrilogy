key launch_tag string; # Each rocket launch in the database is labelled with a unique designation. For successful orbital launches, we use the International Designation (also called the COSPAR designation, after the Committee on Space Research which adopted the system.) For other launches, I use a variation on that scheme of my own design. I introduce the generalized concept of `launch designation' to include the International/COSPAR designation and other similar schemes. The term `piece designation' is also introduced to generalize the per-piece (per-cataloged-object) international designation.
